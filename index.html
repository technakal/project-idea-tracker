            (where it
            will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process
            ends in 1

            25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st
            to 25th
            next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to
            "BC". This
            simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the
            encoded message
            can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.
